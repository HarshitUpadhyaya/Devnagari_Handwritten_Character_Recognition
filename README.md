# Devnagari_Handwritten_Character_Recognition_Model
It is a Devnagari Handwritten Character Recognition model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. 
Naive Bayes algorithm is used for text classification and image recognition tasks. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent of each other.

We will be using the following steps in this model :
1. Preprocessing
2. Feature extraction
3. Data preparation (training and testing sets)
4. Model selection (Naive Bayes Algorithm)
5. Training
6. Evaluation
